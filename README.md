# Kaggle Tabular Playground Series - Clustering Challenge

Welcome to the Kaggle's first ever unsupervised clustering challenge! In this repository, you'll find an approach to tackling this interesting problem using various unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Problem Description

Each row in the dataset provided for this challenge belongs to a particular cluster. The task is to predict the cluster to which each row belongs. The catch is that there are no labels given, no training data, and we don't know how many clusters are present in the ground truth labels. It's a completely unsupervised problem that you might encounter in a real-world setting.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is a simulated manufacturing control data that can be clustered into different control states. The task is to cluster the data into these control states.

## Approach

The project is implemented as a Python program that uses unsupervised learning methods to cluster the data. Various steps of data pre-processing, data exploration, and modeling techniques are applied. 

The following machine learning techniques are employed:

1. KMeans Clustering
2. Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model
3. Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

Detailed visualizations are provided to understand the clusters formed by the models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. 
3. Run the main.py script to apply the unsupervised learning methods and visualize the results.
